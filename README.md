# alignment_score

# Description
The alignment_score function calculates the alignment score between two sequences of characters. It takes into account match scores, mismatch penalties, and indel penalties (insertions or deletions) to assess the quality of the alignment. This function is useful in bioinformatics for scoring sequence alignments in tasks like DNA, RNA, or protein sequence comparisons.

# Features

* Calculates the score for sequence alignment using given match, mismatch, and indel penalties.
* Handles gaps in sequences (indels) and penalizes them according to the specified indel penalty.
* Returns the alignment score based on the sequence comparison.

 # Function

 ```
alignment_score(seq1, seq2, match_score, mismatch_penalty, indel_penalty)
```
# Purpose:
Computes the alignment score between two sequences, considering matching characters, mismatches, and gaps.

# Parameters:
* seq1 (str): The first sequence to align.
* seq2 (str): The second sequence to align.
* match_score (int): The score for matching characters.
* mismatch_penalty (int): The penalty for mismatched characters.
* indel_penalty (int): The penalty for gaps (insertions or deletions).

# Returns:
int: The total alignment score calculated by comparing the two sequences.

# Example
```

seq1 = "TCGAC--ATT"
seq2 = "CC---GAA-T"
match_score = 1
mismatch_penalty = 1
indel_penalty = 2

alignment_score = alignment_score(seq1, seq2, match_score, mismatch_penalty, indel_penalty)
print("Alignment score:", alignment_score)

```


# Expected Output

* Alignment score: -10

# Applications

* Sequence Comparison: Useful for comparing biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.
* Bioinformatics: Helps in scoring and evaluating sequence alignments in various bioinformatics algorithms.
* Genomic Studies: Important in genome assembly, mutation detection, and sequence evolution analysis.
